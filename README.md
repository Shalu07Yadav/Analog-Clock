## Employee Attrition Prediction

This project analyzes employee attrition and identifies factors influencing employees leaving a company through data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset Dataset01-Employee_Attrition.csv includes 14,999 records with columns like job satisfaction, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, years at the company, accidents, promotions, department, and salary.

## Workflow

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates (reduced records to 11,991) and confirmed no missing values.

EDA:

Analyzed attrition based on salary and department.

Visualized numerical feature distributions using box plots.

Key Insights:

Higher salaries correlate with lower attrition.

Sales, support, and technical departments have high attrition rates.

Visualization: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for bar plots and box plots.
